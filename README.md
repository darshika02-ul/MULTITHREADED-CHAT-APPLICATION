##TASK 1: BUILD A CLIENT-SERVER CHAT APPLICATION USING JAVA SOCKETS AND MULTITHREADING TO HANDLE MULTIPLE USERS.
Building a client-server chat application using Java sockets and multithreading enables real-time communication between multiple users over a network. This type of application follows a client-server architecture where a central server manages connections, and multiple clients communicate through it. Java provides Socket and ServerSocket classes to establish network connections, while multithreading ensures multiple clients can interact simultaneously.
The server-side application begins by creating a ServerSocket that listens for incoming client connections on a specific port. When a client attempts to connect, the server accepts the connection, creating a new Socket instance for communication. To handle multiple clients efficiently, the server spawns a new thread for each connected client, allowing simultaneous communication. This is achieved by implementing the Runnable interface or extending the Thread class, where each thread manages an individual client session. The server maintains a list of active clients and broadcasts messages to all connected users, ensuring real-time interaction.
On the client side, a Socket instance connects to the server’s IP address and port. Each client has input and output streams to send and receive messages. A dedicated thread listens for incoming messages from the server, displaying them in real-time. Meanwhile, the main thread captures user input and transmits it to the server. This design ensures smooth, uninterrupted communication as each client can send and receive messages independently.
The core functionality of this chat application includes message broadcasting, where the server forwards received messages to all connected clients. This creates a group chat environment where every participant sees messages in real time. Additionally, the server can implement user identification by assigning unique usernames to clients upon connection. A command system can be added to allow users to exit the chat gracefully or send private messages to specific users.
Error handling is a crucial aspect of this application. The server must handle unexpected client disconnections to prevent inactive connections from consuming system resources. Similarly, clients should handle network failures gracefully, attempting reconnection when necessary. Implementing message encryption using Java’s Cipher class can enhance security, ensuring private conversations remain confidential.
To extend this project, developers can integrate a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX, making the chat more user-friendly. Adding authentication, such as login credentials, can enhance security. Features like file sharing, voice messages, or chat history storage using databases can further improve the application’s functionality.
In conclusion, building a client-server chat application using Java sockets and multithreading provides a solid foundation for real-time communication systems. By leveraging Java’s networking capabilities and multithreading support, developers can create scalable and efficient chat applications. This project serves as an excellent learning experience in network programming, concurrency handling, and real-time data transmission, which are essential skills in modern software development.


##Task 2: DELIVERABLE: A FUNCTIONAL CHAT APPLICATION WITH A SERVER AND MULTIPLE CLIENTS COMMUNICATING IN REAL TIME.
A functional chat application with a server and multiple clients communicating in real time is a powerful implementation of Java sockets and multithreading. This application enables users to connect to a central server, exchange messages in real time, and maintain seamless communication across multiple clients. The core functionality is divided into three main components: the ChatServer, the ClientHandler, and the ChatClient. The server is responsible for managing client connections and broadcasting messages, while the client connects to the server and facilitates user interaction. The use of multithreading ensures that multiple clients can communicate simultaneously without affecting performance.
The ChatServer is the backbone of the application, running on a specified port and continuously listening for incoming connections using a ServerSocket. When a new client connects, the server accepts the connection and assigns a dedicated thread to handle communication with that client. Each connected client is stored in a set of active clients, enabling the server to efficiently manage and broadcast messages. The broadcastMessage method ensures that messages sent by one client are transmitted to all connected clients, allowing for real-time communication. Additionally, when a client disconnects, the server removes the client from the active list, preventing memory leaks and ensuring smooth operation.
The ClientHandler is a crucial component that runs on the server side. Each time a client connects, a new instance of ClientHandler is created and executed in a separate thread. This ensures that messages from different clients can be processed concurrently. The run method listens for incoming messages from the client, processes them, and forwards them to the server for broadcasting. If a client disconnects or encounters an error, the connection is closed gracefully to maintain server stability. This multithreaded approach guarantees efficient handling of multiple users without blocking the server’s main execution thread.
On the client side, the ChatClient connects to the server using a Socket. The client establishes an input-output stream to send and receive messages. Once connected, the client continuously listens for messages from the server using a background thread, ensuring real-time message updates. The user can input text messages, which are sent to the server and broadcasted to all connected users. The use of multithreading prevents blocking operations, allowing the client to simultaneously send and receive messages without delays.
To run the application, the ChatServer must be started first, allowing it to listen for incoming client connections. Next, multiple instances of ChatClient can be executed, representing different users in the chatroom. As clients send messages, they are instantly broadcasted to all active users, ensuring seamless real-time communication. The implementation can be further enhanced by integrating a graphical user interface (GUI), encrypting messages for security, or implementing user authentication.
In conclusion, this Java chat application efficiently utilizes sockets and multithreading to create a real-time communication platform. The server manages multiple clients, ensuring smooth data exchange, while the client provides an interactive interface for users to send and receive messages. This project serves as a strong foundation for building advanced chat applications, whether for internal team communication, customer support, or social networking.
