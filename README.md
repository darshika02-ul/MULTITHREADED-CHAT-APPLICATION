# MULTITHREADED-CHAT-APPLICATION

##Task 2: 
A functional chat application with a server and multiple clients communicating in real time is a powerful implementation of Java sockets and multithreading. This application enables users to connect to a central server, exchange messages in real time, and maintain seamless communication across multiple clients. The core functionality is divided into three main components: the ChatServer, the ClientHandler, and the ChatClient. The server is responsible for managing client connections and broadcasting messages, while the client connects to the server and facilitates user interaction. The use of multithreading ensures that multiple clients can communicate simultaneously without affecting performance.
The ChatServer is the backbone of the application, running on a specified port and continuously listening for incoming connections using a ServerSocket. When a new client connects, the server accepts the connection and assigns a dedicated thread to handle communication with that client. Each connected client is stored in a set of active clients, enabling the server to efficiently manage and broadcast messages. The broadcastMessage method ensures that messages sent by one client are transmitted to all connected clients, allowing for real-time communication. Additionally, when a client disconnects, the server removes the client from the active list, preventing memory leaks and ensuring smooth operation.
The ClientHandler is a crucial component that runs on the server side. Each time a client connects, a new instance of ClientHandler is created and executed in a separate thread. This ensures that messages from different clients can be processed concurrently. The run method listens for incoming messages from the client, processes them, and forwards them to the server for broadcasting. If a client disconnects or encounters an error, the connection is closed gracefully to maintain server stability. This multithreaded approach guarantees efficient handling of multiple users without blocking the serverâ€™s main execution thread.
On the client side, the ChatClient connects to the server using a Socket. The client establishes an input-output stream to send and receive messages. Once connected, the client continuously listens for messages from the server using a background thread, ensuring real-time message updates. The user can input text messages, which are sent to the server and broadcasted to all connected users. The use of multithreading prevents blocking operations, allowing the client to simultaneously send and receive messages without delays.
To run the application, the ChatServer must be started first, allowing it to listen for incoming client connections. Next, multiple instances of ChatClient can be executed, representing different users in the chatroom. As clients send messages, they are instantly broadcasted to all active users, ensuring seamless real-time communication. The implementation can be further enhanced by integrating a graphical user interface (GUI), encrypting messages for security, or implementing user authentication.
In conclusion, this Java chat application efficiently utilizes sockets and multithreading to create a real-time communication platform. The server manages multiple clients, ensuring smooth data exchange, while the client provides an interactive interface for users to send and receive messages. This project serves as a strong foundation for building advanced chat applications, whether for internal team communication, customer support, or social networking.
